batteries -- Powers your OpenSCAD designs
=========================================

A work-in-progress standard library for OpenSCAD.

The idea is to make OpenSCAD code more legible by providing a stronger set of
primitives, and providing mathematical functions for common trig operations
that it more explicit how you derived your math.
